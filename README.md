# Mediadex

Index media metadata into elasticsearch

## Usage

Give mediadex a path with music or movies:
```
mediadex --path /srv/music
```

... and watch as an elasticsearch index is quickly built!

You can now query elasticsearch about your media metadata with your
favourite tool such as kibana or curl.
